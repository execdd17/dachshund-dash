# Dachshund Dash

A pixel-art endless runner starring the world's most determined wiener dog. Jump over hershey bars, duck under frisbees, and chase down squirrels — all from your browser.

Inspired by Chrome's Dino Run, but with more personality (and more hot dogs).

## How to Play

- **Jump**: Space, Up Arrow, tap, or click
- **Duck**: Down Arrow or S
- **Double jump**: Press jump again mid-air

That's it. No tutorials, no loading screens, no accounts. Just run.

**Note:** Best played on desktop — mobile works for jumping, but there's no way to duck (yet), and you'll need to duck.

## What You'll Find

- A hand-animated dachshund with pixel-art sprites
- A day/night cycle with sunsets, starry skies, and dynamic weather
- A soulful soundtrack (with an EDM remix for special occasions)
- Squirrel chases and a boss encounter
- Giant mode — grab a golden hot dog and become unstoppable
- Local and global high score leaderboards

## Run It Locally

Open `index.html` in any browser. No build step, no dependencies, no framework. It's one file and it just works.
